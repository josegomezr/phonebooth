Phonebooth <!-- (this name surely will change) -->
===

I wanna build my own VoIP call thing for myself.

Is 2021 and every single simple tool in this planet requires you to download an app, browsers are complete machines on their own, can show up stuff and even do [FLUID SIMULATION](https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/) but you're required to use an app on your phone.

I'm a bit tired of it tbh, every service provider today just doesn't provide service, they want always more "closeness" to your own, and I'm not that "comfty" with that fact anymore. So I started with a simple chore: My calls to Venezuela.

Later here there will be deployment details & more info, for now enjoy my rant ;)
